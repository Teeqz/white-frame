# WhiteFrame

Complete package containing several components for developing resource based applications (like admin theme, dashboards based on datas ...).

WhiteFrame allows you to upgrade your application classes like `Controllers`, `Models` and add components like `Presenters` and `Repositories`. It bring to your application powerfull functions based the `Models` configuration such as widgets for generating _ajax table_ with show/edit/delete buttons, classes for extracting statistics for a _dynamic chart_, etc ...

With the highly configurable `Model`, you can specify the `Presenter`, the `Repository`, the url endpoint and the view folder. This allow you to build automatic `Controller`, serving correct views on the correct url for the object.

# Installation

We built a simple boilerplate with bootstrap and the opensource AdminLTE template. As it brings some front end logic, WhiteFrame require some bower packages in addition to the basic composer requirement.
